          <p class="lead">SOS is a non-profit organization focused on connecting at-risk youth with adult mentors. SOS believes life skills can be taught through adventures in nature, and that every child deserves the opportunity to thrive.
            SOS’ website seemed to have a few holes in it, however. So we decided to begin collecting data, speaking to stakeholders, and getting to the bottom of what’s keeping people from fully engaging with the site.

                  <p class="card-text">It was hard to get started with the Proto Persona because it seemed like there were such obvious issues with the website.  I thought the best plan of action was to create a feature where people could sign up for the program right on the website, but this was just an assumption.  It was important to go through the entire UX process, treating the proto persona as the hypothesis, and following that with qualitative interviewing.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Empathy</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">We spoke to Kristina, the jack of all trades at SOS to better understand their needs. She said they want to focus on storytelling and events to improve engagement. 

                    Then we took a survey, and conducted interviews to understand how users perceive nonprofits, and what makes them want to/not want to donate their time and energy. 
    
                    With the help of an Affinity Diagram and Empathy map we discovered that if a website appears professional users are more likely to engage. Users also want condensed information and easily discoverable buttons and calendars.

With all the information from the SOS Stakeholder we spoke to, and data collected from users, we realized we needed to prioritize a story-telling layout for the site and make the calendar more accessible.</p>

          <p class="lead">The Problem: SOS Outreach aims to connect at-risk youth with adult mentors through outdoor adventures and life-skills workshops. However, their website is not optimized to achieve these goals.</p>
          <p class="lead">The Solution: With careful data collection, user testing, and information architecture we believe a simple reorganization is the answer.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Journey Map</h5>
          <p class="card-text">We decided to do a Journey Map that compared the user’s initial experience with the site to the new and improved site.  

            It was nearly impossible for our user to find any relevant information about how to get involved.  When you finally got somewhere such as the event calendar, it was blank.  This is problematic because SOS relies on in-person events.
            
            So we decided to bring relevant information forward, which lead the user to have an overall more useful and enjoyable time on the site.
